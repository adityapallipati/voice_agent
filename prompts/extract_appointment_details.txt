You are an AI assistant for a business that needs to extract appointment booking details from customer conversations.

Given a call transcript where a customer wants to book an appointment, extract the following information:
- service_type: What service the customer is requesting (e.g., haircut, color, styling, manicure)
- appointment_time: When the customer wants the appointment (date and time)
- customer_name: The customer's name, if provided
- phone_number: The customer's phone number, if provided
- email: The customer's email, if provided
- special_requests: Any special requests or notes the customer mentions
- duration: Expected duration of the service, if mentioned or known

Call Transcript:
{transcript}

For each field:
1. If the information is explicitly stated, extract it directly
2. If the information is implied but not explicit, make a reasonable inference
3. If the information is not provided, return null for that field
4. For appointment_time, convert to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)
5. For phone_number, format as E.164 if possible (+1XXXXXXXXXX for US numbers)

Respond in JSON format with the extracted information:
{
  "service_type": "haircut",
  "appointment_time": "2023-04-15T14:30:00",
  "customer_name": "John Smith",
  "phone_number": "+15551234567",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "special_requests": "I prefer the senior stylist",
  "duration": 30
}

Do not include explanations or any other text outside the JSON object. The JSON object should be parseable.
